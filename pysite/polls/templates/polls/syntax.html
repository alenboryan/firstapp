        <h2>Python - Syntax</h2>
        <p>The Python syntax defines a set of rules that are used to create a Python Program. The Python Programming Language Syntax has many similarities to Perl, C, and Java Programming Languages. However, there are some definite differences between the languages.</p>
        
        <!-- First Python Program -->
        <h3>First Python Program</h3>
        <p>Let us execute a Python program to print "Hello, World!" in two different modes of Python Programming. (a) Interactive Mode Programming (b) Script Mode Programming.</p>

        <!-- Python - Interactive Mode Programming -->
        <h4>Python - Interactive Mode Programming</h4>
        <p>We can invoke a Python interpreter from the command line by typing <code>python3</code> at the command prompt. Here <code>>>></code> denotes a Python Command Prompt where you can type your commands.</p>
        <!-- Add more content here -->

        <!-- Python - Script Mode Programming -->
        <h4>Python - Script Mode Programming</h4>
        <p>We can invoke the Python interpreter with a script parameter which begins the execution of the script and continues until the script is finished.</p>
        <!-- Add more content here -->

        <!-- Python Identifiers -->
        <h3>Python Identifiers</h3>
        <p>A Python identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters, underscores and digits (0 to 9).</p>
        <!-- Add more content here -->

        <!-- Python Reserved Words -->
        <h3>Python Reserved Words</h3>
        <p>The following list shows the Python keywords. These are reserved words and you cannot use them as constant or variable or any other identifier names. All the Python keywords contain lowercase letters only.</p>
        <!-- Add more content here -->

        <!-- Python Lines and Indentation -->
        <h3>Python Lines and Indentation</h3>
        <p>Python programming provides no braces to indicate blocks of code for class and function definitions or flow control. Blocks of code are denoted by line indentation, which is rigidly enforced.</p>
        <!-- Add more content here -->

        <!-- Python Multi-Line Statements -->
        <h3>Python Multi-Line Statements</h3>
        <p>Statements in Python typically end with a new line. Python does, however, allow the use of the line continuation character (\) to denote that the line should continue.</p>
        <!-- Add more content here -->

        <!-- Quotations in Python -->
        <h3>Quotations in Python</h3>
        <p>Python accepts single ('), double (") and triple (''' or """) quotes to denote string literals, as long as the same type of quote starts and ends the string.</p>
        <!-- Add more content here -->

        <!-- Comments in Python -->
        <h3>Comments in Python</h3>
        <p>A comment is a programmer-readable explanation or annotation in the Python source code. They are added with the purpose of making the source code easier for humans to understand, and are ignored by the Python interpreter.</p>
        <!-- Add more content here -->

        <!-- Using Blank Lines in Python Programs -->
        <h3>Using Blank Lines in Python Programs</h3>
        <p>A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line and Python totally ignores it.</p>
        <!-- Add more content here -->

        <!-- Waiting for the User -->
        <h3>Waiting for the User</h3>
        <p>The following line of the program displays the prompt, the statement saying “Press the enter key to exit”, and waits for the user to take action.</p>
        <!-- Add more content here -->

        <!-- Multiple Statements on a Single Line -->
        <h3>Multiple Statements on a Single Line</h3>
        <p>The semicolon ( ; ) allows multiple statements on the single line given that neither statement starts a new code block.</p>
        <!-- Add more content here -->

        <!-- Multiple Statement Groups as Suites -->
        <h3>Multiple Statement Groups as Suites</h3>
        <p>A group of individual statements, which make a single code block are called suites in Python. Compound or complex statements, such as if, while, def, and class require a header line and a suite.</p>
        <!-- Add more content here -->

        <!-- Command Line Arguments in Python -->
        <h3>Command Line Arguments in Python</h3>
        <p>Many programs can be run to provide you with some basic information about how they should be run. Python enables you to do this with <code>-h</code></p>
